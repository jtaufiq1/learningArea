# --[ NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
Network topologies deals with how devices are connected.

## Hierarchical Model
Hierarchical model simplifies design, implementation and management of network.
This model consists of 3 layers: Core, Distribution and Access.

* Core/Backbone
- High bandwidth for quick packet switching within network with fast and efficient data transport.
- Connects distribution layer to each other and the centralized resources.
- Consists of high-speed routers and Multi-layer switches.

* Distribution
- Separation layer between core and access layers
- Defines local policies and local routing. Controls access  to resources at the core layer.
- Routing, packet filtering using ACLs and Quality of Services (QoS)
- WAN access is at this layer. Routers are used in this layer.

* Access
- End devices connects to the network usually with switches, bridges, hubs.
- End users data transmission access the network at the access layer.
- Control client access to the network resources
