# DNS FUNDAMENTALS
-------------------
(_Eddy Winstead (ISC), NANOG U Webinar, January 2022_)

DNS maps names to numbers & numbers to names. Phonebook of the internet
Designed in 1983 by _Paul Mockapetris_

## The Internet
----------------
	- 1969 first four nodes of the ARPANET
	- 1971 RFC 226 adopted by the network with 20 nodes, communicate via Telnet protocol	
	- 1983 ARPANET Transitioned to TCP/IP Protocol suite
	- hosts.txt file contains IP addresses and names of all internet hosts and services
	- Drawbacks: Maintained by single entity; pulled manually from single host; namespace collisions;

## DNS RFC's
-------------
	- Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) maintains RFC's
	- 1981 RFC 799: Internet Name Domains
	- 1983 RFC 882: Domain Names -- Concepts and Facilities &
	- RFC 883: Domain Names -- Implementations and Specifications
	
## DNS Design Goals
-------------------
	- Expand the namespace
	- Delegate responsibility of updating
	- Minimize network traffic
	- Single mechanism for both name and address lookup
	- Extensible protocol for future needs
	- Distributed management
	- Global access
	- Scalability
