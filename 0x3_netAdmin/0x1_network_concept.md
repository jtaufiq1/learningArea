# --[ INTRODUCTION - NETWORKING FUNDAMENTALS
* Group of computers (nodes) connected to communicate, share data/resources together.
* Uses a set standards (protocol) to communicates to each other.
* The connection can within a small area or can span a large geographical area or the whole world.
  
A network is collection hosts or network devices connected together using standard protocols in order to communicate and share resources together.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF COMPUTER NETWORKS
- Devices in a network are connected either physically or logically using a special hardware/software or both.
- End devices are found at the network edge.
- End device in a network is sometimes referred to as a host or node, workstation or server.
- End devices run network application that request or respond to a service.
- Servers are often found in data centers and run services.
- A client issues a request to a server and a server responds to a clients' requests.
- A hosts/nodes in a network communicate using a standard protocol.
- All nodes in a network have a unique identity and communicate through a connection media.
- Robustness

### Uses/Advantages of Computer Networks
- Sharing of resources. Eg: files, printers, storage etc.
- Enhances remote communication or information access.
- Data/resource security and management.
- Inter- active entertainment.
- Scalability.

### Disadvantages of Computer Networks
- High costs of networking tools (hardware and software).
- Administrative and management cost.
- Requires technical knowledge.
- Data security concerns such as undesirable sharing and illegal intrusions.
- Rise for bandwidth issues.

## COMPONENTS OF A NETWORK
* Hosts/Nodes devices (Workstations/servers)
	- Clients: Clients sends request to servers.
	- Servers: serves data to clients or responds to client requests.
* Network Interface Card (NIC)

* Transmission media (cable/wireless)
	- Cables: connects different devices using wires (copper/optic).
 	- Fiber Optics: uses pulses of light to transfer data.
 	- Eg: Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6
* Hub devices (hub, switch/bridge, router/gateway, repeater)
 	- Hubs: allows many devices to connect. Collision Domain very common
	- Repeater: Repeaters help to regenerate signals as it travels through the trasmission media.
	- Bridge: A device that learns which hosts are connected to hub
	- Switches: Multi ports bridge that facilitate communication within a network.
	- Router: Forwards data between independent networks. Contains routing table. Forward traffic from a host to the ISP.
				Routers share data using Border Gateway Protocols (BGP).
* Protocols


## CLASSIFICATIONS OF COMPUTER NETWORKS
[ ] Transmission Technique (Point-to-point or broadcast)
[ ] Services provided
[ ] Connection Method (Ethernet, token-ring etc)
[x] Architecture (peer-to-peer, client-server or active networking)
[x] Scale/Geographical connection (LAN, WAN etc)
[x] Topology (Bus, ring, star etc)

### Network Architecture
* Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
* Client-Server
* Active Networking

### Geographical Network Connection
* Local Area Network (LAN)
* Personal Area Network (PAN)
* Methropolitan Area Network (MAN)
* Campus Area Network (CAN)
* Wide Area Network (WAN)
* Internet
	The Internet (inter-networks) is the interconnection different networks from/in different locations to share and communicate.
