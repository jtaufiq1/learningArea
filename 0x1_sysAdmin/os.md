# THE MODERN OPERATING SYSTEMS

## Operating System (OS)
Software that runs on the hardware [in kernel mode] and provides a programmer an abstract interface for hardware resources and its' management.

OS Architecture (Instructions Sets (IA), Memory Organization, I/O and Bus Structure).
OS contains many drivers for controlling I/O devices.
OS creates good abstraction and then implements and manage abstract objects created.

Modern OS consists of many devices not limited to; processes, memories, timers, mice, network interfaces, printers and wide variety of devices.
The function of the OS is to manage all the pieces of the complex system and orderly allocation of these resources to programs.

OS Resource management includes *MULTIPLEXING* resources in 2 different ways: in Time & in Space.

Time Multiplexing: Different programs takes turns using resources on 1st come 1st serve basis.
Space Multiplexing: Memory and Disk are resources that are shared for running programs
