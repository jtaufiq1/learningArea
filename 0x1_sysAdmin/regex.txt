--[ REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

A pattern that describes a set of strings
- Basic Regular Expression (BRE)
- Extended Regualar Expression (ERE)
- Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) (pcresyntax|pcrepattern)

* Fundamentals 
- Match single character (letters & digits)
- Meta-character with special meaning is quoted with a preceeding backslash(\)

'.'		- Matches any single character
'?'		- Optionally matches the preceeding character at most ones
'*'		- Matches the preceeding character zero or more times.
'+'		- Matches the preceeding character one or more times.
'{N}'	- Match N times
'{N,}'	- Match N or more times
'{,M}'	- Match at most M times
'{N,M}'	- Match at least N times but not more than M times
'^'		- Match beginning of line
'$'		- Match the end of line

Empty expression match empty strings
Two regex maybe concatenated
Two regex maybe joined with (|) operator; resulting string matches either alternate expression
Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turns take precedence over alternation.
A whole expression may be enclosed in parentheses '()' to override the precedence rules to form subexpression
An unmatched ')' matches itself
