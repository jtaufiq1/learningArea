#--[ General Networking Concepts
## Computer Network
A network is collection hosts or network devices connected together using standard protocols in order to communicate and share resources together.

## Characteristics of Computer Networks
* Devices in a network are connected either physically or logically using a special hardware/software or both.
* End devices are found at the network edge.
* End device in a network is sometimes referred to as a host or node, workstation or server.
* End devices run network application that request or respond to a service.
* Servers are often found in data centers run services.
* A client issues a request to a server and a server responds to a clients' requests.
* A hosts/nodes in a network communicate using a standard protocol.
* All nodes in a network have a unique identity and communicate through a connection media.
* Robustness

## Uses/Advantages of Computer Networks
* Sharing of resources. Eg: files, printers, storage etc.
* Enhances remote communication or information access.
* Data/resource security and management.
* Interactive entertainment.
* Scalability.

## Disadvantages of Computer Networks
* High costs of networking tools (hardware and software).
* Administrative and management cost.
* Requires technical knowledge.
* Data security concerns such as undesirable sharing and illegal intrusions.
* Rise for bandwidth issues.

## Components of a network
* Hosts/Nodes devices (Workstations/servers)
* Network Interface Card (NIC)
* Hub devices (hub, switch/bridge, router/gateway, repeater).
* Transmission media (cable/wireless)
* Protocols

## Classifications of Computer Networks
- [ ] Transmission Technique (Point-to-point or broadcast)
- [ ] Services provided
- [ ] Connection Method (Ethernet, token-ring etc)
- [x] Architecture (peer-to-peer, client-server or active networking)
- [x] Scale/Geographical connection (LAN, WAN etc)
- [x] Topology (Bus, ring, star etc)
