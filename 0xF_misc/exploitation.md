# THE ART OF EXPLOITATION

## 0x100 - INTRODUCTION
Hackers, since the infancy of computers, have creatively help in solving problems in an **elegance** manner.
Hackers persue knowledge itself by continually learning and exploring to trascend the boundaries.
Hackers are both those who write code and exploit it.

## 0x200 - PROGRAMMING
Understanding of programming helps those who exploit codes, and understanding of exploitation helps those who program to write code and technique used to exploit programs.

Programming is just a series of statement written in a specific language. Computers only understand machine language, instructions for computers must be in the machine language for the computer to follow.

Machine language consists of raw bits and bytes, differs from architecture to architecture. A translator is used to overcome the overhead of writing machine language.

An assembly is one form of machine-language translator. It translates assembly language into machine readable code; thus less cryptic.

Another form translator is the compiler, it converts higher-level language instructions into machine language. Higher level languages are much intuitive than assembly language and can be converted into many different types of machine language for different processor architectures.

C/C++, Fortran are examples of higher level languages. Higher level languages are much more readable than assembly language or machine language but follows very strict rules about wording of instructions.

### PSEUDO-CODE
Another form of programming language which is generally structured in English similar to a higher level language.
It is a useful way for programmers to arrange instructions. It isn't a well defined language. There are slight variations in pseud-code of different programmers.
It makes an excellent introduction common programming concepts. Compilers, assemblers or any computer do not understand pseudo-codes.

### CONTROL STRUCTURES
Control structures change the flow of the program's execution from simply sequencial other to a more complex and more useful flow.
* IF-ELSE STATEMENT
* WHILE LOOP
* UNTIL THEN
* FOR LOOP

### FUNDAMENTAL PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS
* Variables: An object that holds data that can change or a constant which doesn't change.
* Arithmetic Operators: Addition +, Subtraction -, Multiplication \*, Modulo %, and Division /.
* Comparison Operators: Less than <, Greater than >, Less or Equal <=, Greater or Equal >=, equal ==, and Not Equal !=.
* Logical Operators: OR ||, AND && and NOT !.
* Functions: Grouping of instructions into a smaller sub program used within a program.
