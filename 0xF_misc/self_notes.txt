# MINIMALIST HABITS
1. Declutter yourself and environment & Prefer Quality over Quantity & Simple finance
2. Set Goals for each quarter and section the days in 3s. 1/3rd of each day goal for one goal.
3. Space optimization: Organize to max space
4. Optimal sleep and healthy life style: Evening Routine

Spend less time thinking about the unnecessary things
Now lock in on the goals and use the momentum
