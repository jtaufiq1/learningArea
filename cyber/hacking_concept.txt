--[ Hacking Concepts
* Hacking
- Exploiting system vulnerabilities and bypassing security controls.
- Gaining unauthorized access to an IS or resources on an information system.
- Involves modification of systems or application features to attain a goal
- Not originally by definition of the system or application.
- Hacking can be used for good or bad purpose
- The effect of unethical hacking can lead to bad consequencies to a system or an organization

Motives Behind hacking are diverse, some include;
- Theft, distrupt services
- gain more knowledge, recognition
- curiosity and many others

* Hacker
- Creative individual with excellent skills in computer
- creates and explores software and hardware and even with the ability to
- discover vulnerabilities in a system.
- Some hack as a hobby whiles others hack for malicious intentions.
- Hacking can be used for good or malicious activities.
 
* Hacker Classes
 - Black Hat
 - White Hat
 - Grey Hat
 - Script Kiddies
 - Suicide Hackers
 - Cyber Terrorists
 - Hacktivists
 - State-Sponsored Hackers

--[ Hacking Phases

*  Reconnaissance
Preparatory stage when an attacker gathers info about the target.

Range may include target org-clients, network, systems etc.

There are 2 types of Recon: Passive Recon & Active Recon
- Passive recon
No direct interaction with the target.
- Active recon
Involves directly interaction with the target

* Scanning (Pre-Atttack Phase)
Active probing of target before attacking. Scanning the network for specific information.

Port Scanner
Network mappers, Port scanner, ping tools, vulnerability scanners.
Information extracted from this stage is used to launch attack.

* Gaining Access
Obtaining access to the target network, OS or application

Access can be OS, Application or Network Level and can escalate privileges to obtain complete control.
Password cracking, DDoS, Buffer Overflow, Session Hijacking are some the ways of taken control of target system.

* Maintaining Access
Retaining ownership of compromised system. Securing exclusive access with Backdoors, rootkits and trojans.
Allows download, manipulation of data/application/configuration of the system.
And a launch point for further attacks.

* Clearing Tracks
Activities carried out by an attacker on compromised system to;
- Hide malicious acts
- Maintain access
- Avoid detection
- Deleting/overriding evidence to avoid suspicions

Attackers/Hackers always cover their tracks.
