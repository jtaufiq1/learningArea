--[ CYBER KILL CHAIN
A detailed plan of defense and prevention of intrusion activities.

* Reconnaissance: Information gathering on Target - Org, systems and users.
- Public information
- Organization information
- Network information
- Systems information
- Specific IP's and Employees information
- Monitoring and analyzing target's website
- Whois, DNS and Network footprinting
- Scanning to Identify open ports and services.

* Weaponization: Using gathered information to find vulnerabilites to
 exploit the target.
- Exploit are tailored to targets after analyzing the information gathered.
- Creating exploit based on vulnerabilities

* Delivery: Getting the exploit to the target
 - Sending phishing mails
 - Rogue USB drives
 - Developing and Performing several attack methods

* Exploitation
- Running malicious code on the target system to exploit vulnerability.
- Some attacks the target may face authentication and authorization attack,
- Security misconfiguration, physical security threat or arbitrary code exec
- To exploit software or hardware of the target system to gain [remote]
- access.

* Installation
- Malicious softwares are installed on the target systems to maintain access.
- Spread to other systems on the network and tries to hide activities.
- Hiding malicious activities

* Command & Control (C2)
- Establish two-way communication channel between advesary control server
- And victims system.
- Applying privilege escalation techniques
- Hiding evidence of compromise using techniques such as encryption.

* Actions on Objectives (Goals)
- Controlling target system from a remote location
- Gaining access to confidential data
- Distrupting of service
- Launch point to perform other attacks

--[ TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, and PROCEEDURES (TTPs)
Patterns of activities and method associated with specific threat actor or
group of threat actors.
Very useful for analyzing threat and profiling threat actors.
Can be used to strengthen security.

* Tactics
- The guidelines that describe the way an attacker performs attacks
- Tactics for gathering information to initial exploitation
- Privilege escalation, lateral movement and measures to ensure persistent
- access to the systems and other purposes.
- Mode of operation in the different phases of the attack.

* Techniques
- Set of tools and their usage in achieving intermediate results.
- Technical methods used to achieve intermediate results.
- Initial exploitation, setting up C2 channels, accessing targets     infrastructure
- data exfiltration and covering of tracks on targets systems.

* Procedures
- Sequence of actions carried out by threat actors at different stages in the 
  attack life cycle.
- such procedures differs by threat actors and objectives behind the attack.
- And becomes more sophisticated when done by an APT group
 (Advanced Persisten Threat)

--[ ADVERSARY BEHAVIORAL IDENTIFICATION
Identification of common methods or techniques used by adversary to attack or
penetrate an organization's network.
Such identifications gives security professionals insight on upcoming threat and exploits thereby planning network security and adapting ranges of security
measures as means of prevention various cyber attacks.

Some activities include:
* Internal Reconnaissance
* Use of Powershell
* Unspecified Proxy Activities
* Use of command-Line Interface
* HTTP User Agent
* Command and Control Server
* DNS Tunneling
* Use of Web Shell
* Data Staging

--[ INDICATORS of COMPROMISE (IoCs)
IoCs are the clues, artifacts or pieces of forensic data that
indicates potential intrusion in a network or operating system in an
organization

They acts as good source of information regarding a threat.
Continuous monitoring of IoCs effectively and efficiently detects and respond
to evolving cyber attacks.

* Groups of IoCs
- Network Indicators
- Email Indicators
- Host-based Indicators
- Behavioral Indicators

* Key IoCs
- Unusual outbound network traffic
- Unusual activities through a priviledge user account
- Geographical anomalies
- Multiple Login failures
- Increased database read volume
- Multiple request for the same file size
- Mismatched port-application traffic
- Suspicious registry or system file changes
- Unusual DNS requests
- Unexpected patching of systems
- Signs of DDoS activities
- Bundles of data in the wrong places
- Web traffic with superhuman behavior
