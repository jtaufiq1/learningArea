                        BEING A HACKER
                      ------------------
--[ For the Love of Hacking

Hackers are motivated, resourceful and creative; they get deeply into
how things work to the point that they know how to take control of them
and change them into something else.

They re-think big ideas because they can really get into the bottom of 
how things function.

They aren't afraid of making the same mistakes just out of curiosity,
to see that if that mistake has the same results.

Hackers don't see failure as a mistake or a waste of time. Failure means
something new is to be learned.

Hackers enjoy challenging themselves to tinker with everything they have.

Don't think you can just be a great hacker only by doing great hacks.
With humiliy can you be great.


--[ Hacking as a Research

Hacking is a research. Although it doesn't follow formal hypothesis. It
involves deeply examine something, make adjustment and pushing it beyond
its normal operation.

Deep knowledge gives you great power. Cool things can be done with hacking
skills. Any knowledge that can help you to a point that you can take control
of what is in your hand. That is hacking.

Hack everything but harm none.


--[ How to Hack

Learning how to hack involve developing the skills, feeling and intuition
by practising. And then keep practising.

I am going to use OSSTMM as a guide to learn hacking in this documents.


--[ Ways to get what you want

- Take it yourself
- Have someone take it for you

All takens requires *INTERACTIONS* between the person and the thing.

Some of this interactions are between people, things or systems that 
are familiar with each other. This interaction is called *TRUST*.

But when the interaction is between unknown people, things or systems, it is
called *ACCESS*.

You can use access to take what you want OR you can trick someone who has
trust with the target to take it for you.

Hence *SECURITY* means protecting something from both those it doesn't know and
those it knows and trusts.
Therefore *SECURITY means protecting an *assert from those who have *access to 
it and those it knows and *trusts.

# Exercise

1. What kind of interaction is using search engine?
** using search engine to search for information is an access. 
   No one is given trust before accessing the information.
   
2. Using access and trust to take a locked bicycle packed to a bike rack.
** You can interact with a locked bicycle by breaking the lock from
   the bike rack to gain access. No trust is gained from the entity.
** The owner of the bicycle who is familiar with the bicycle and with the
   lock key can unlock the bicycle from the bike rack without breaking
   the lock. Trust is gained from the the entity.
** The key of the locked bicycle can be obtain from the owner of the bicycle
   to unlock it. Access is used to unlock it.

3. Using access and trust to login into another person's web-mail account
** Login into a web-mail account requires email and password from
   a familiar entity (account owner).
   Account owner enters the username/email and password in the respective
   field. Trust from a familiar entity is used to login.
** An entity brute-force someone's mail account to gain access to the 
   account.
   An entity enters possible email&password combinations to gain access to 
   the web-mail account.
   An entity tricks the web-mail account owner to get username&password of
   the web-mail account to login into the account.
   ACCESS is used to login to the web-mail account.
   

--[ Feed Your Head: Espionage

- Espionage: hacking against foreign government to commit criminal acts to get
  an edge in political/military information. Acts includes: 
  * Breaking and entering
  * Trespassing
  * Theft
  * Destruction

- Economic Espionage: A foreign business hacking another business in a
  different country to get an edge in business.

- DoXing: Hacking used to get private and personal information on individual
  people to embarass them publicly.

- OSInt: Open Source Intelligence or Document Grinding. Digging out public 
  information to target a person/company for an attack.

- Network Surveying: Using Hacking to understand a target's(company) network,
  systems, applications and devices without actually intruding into the
  systems.

- Competitive Intelligence: Hacking deeply to understand a competitor without
  breaking any law.

--[ Hacking to Take Over Your World

Hacking is all about taking control of something or changing it. Having freedom
to make something you own do what you want. And then keep others from changing
something you own.

For many people, Security is about putting a product in a place that 
theorotically keeps them secure. Security products are meant to reduce *Attack
Surface. But sometimes, products comes with their own problems or don't work as
they should. Thus, increasing the attack surface when it should be shrinking it.

-- Attack surface is all the ways, all the interactions that allow something/
   someone to be attacked.
-- You hack security to analyze the product to figure out where it fails and
   how to change it so it works better. Then hacking some more to prevent changing it back to the default.   
-- Breaking security is one area that hacking is useful for protecting your own
   privacy.

Another type of interaction known as *VISIBILITY is also very powerful as the
other two. It is simplified as an opportunity to know if there is something to
interact with or not.

This interaction bring a whole lot of security techniques like deception,
illusion and camouflage as well as all-new hacking techniques for avoiding and
getting around security measures like deception, illusion and camouflage!

Privacy is the opposite of visibility. It is a powerful way to avoid being a
target.
To avoid attacks in the first place, Keep a low *EXPOSURE and avoid visibility.

** Basic Interactions
-- Trust
-- Access
-- Visibility and Exposure

--[ The Four Point Process (FPP)

Putting the 3 types of interactions together gives us *POROSITY, the basis of an
attack surface.

Porosity is simply the pores/holes in any defenses you have in order for the
necessary interactions to take place as well as unknown and unnecessary
interactions taken place.

Knowing porosity helps in protecting yourself from attack or help to attack 
some target but not enough to analyze something to hack it.

The Four Point Process outlines 4 ways the basic interactions are used to
analyze something as deeply as possible. (Mess with it, watch it and observe
the outcome)

** The Echo Process
We grow up discovering things and learning things by interacting with them
directly. Poking to check the status of something (Dead/Alive) is known as the
*ECHO PROCESS (send request and receive reply)

It requires throwing different types of *Access* interaction at a target and
then monitoring its reactions to figure out what ways you can interact with it.
Thus *Cause-and-Effect* type of verification.

Although it makes for a very fast test, it isn't very accurate. Eg: A target
that doesn't respond to an echo process is considered secure. Which is the same 
as not having visibility.
Not responding to a particular type of interaction does not mean it is secured.
Avoiding visibility might help you survive some types of attacks but not all.

** The Four Point Process (FPP)
The FPP has you look at interactions in the following ways:

-- Induction:
   * Information about target from its environment
   * How does the target behave in its environment?
   * Is the target influenced by its environment?
-- Inquest:
   * What signals does the target gives off?
   * A system or process generally leaves a signature of interaction with its
     environment.
   * Investigate tracks or indicators of those emanations.
-- Interaction:
   * What happens when you poke it? This point calls for echo tests, including
     expected and unexpected interaction with the target, to trigger responses.
-- Intervention:
   * How far will it bend before it breaks?
   * Meddle with its interactions with other systems to understand the extremes
     under which it can continue operating.
   * Intervene with resources the target needs.
 
--[ What to Hack

Setting up ground rules is important before hacking anything.
The *SCOPE is the word used to describe the possible operating environment,
which is every interaction that the thing you want hack has.
Knowing the language and the concept of what you are actually hacking is a MUST.

** Classes and Channels
The scope is made up of 3 channels that subdivides to 5 channels.

-- Physical Security (PHYSEC):
 * Human 
 * Physical

-- Spectrum Security (SPECSEC):
 * Wireless

-- Communication Security (COMSEC):
 * Telecommunication
 * Data Networks

Classes are labels that define an area of study, investigation or operation.

Channels are common terms for the ways you interact with assets.

An *Assert is anything that has value to the owner. It can be physical property
or intellectual property

Dependencies are things beyond the asset owner's ability to provide.

The goal of *Security is separation between an asserts as well as its 
dependencies and any threat to them. Thus security is a function of separation.

There are four ways to create this separation:
- Move the asset to create a barrier between it and the threats.
- Change the threat to a harmless state.
- Destroy the threat.
- Destroy the asset. ![NOT RECOMMENDED]

When we are hacking, we look places where interactions with the target are 
possible and where they are not. We analyze them with the FPP.

** Porosity
How pores can be located, classified and determined during the hacking process.

-- Visibility: Ways to find opportunity. If an asset is visible, it can be
   attacked but if not visible, it can be targeted.
-- Access: The number of different places where interactions can occure to the
   outside of the scope.
-- Trust: When an entity accepts free interactions with another entity within
   the scope. Trust is both security hole and common replacement for
   authentication.

--[ Resources

Effective research and critical thinking are the key/vital skills for a hacker.
Hacking, in reality, is a creative process based more on lifestyle than lesson.

And that is what separates a hacker from a script kiddie.
