                        Hacking as a Research 
- Hack everything but harm none.
- Deep knowledge gives you great power. Knowing how to do something
  to the point that you can take control of it.
- Don't think you can just be a great hacker Only by doing great hacks,
  with humility can you be great.

+ Searching information using a search engine is an access because
   that's the point of interacting with the search engine to find
   visible information with the search query.

+ Given an example with a locked bicycle;
  - An entity can interact with the locked bicycle in a
    number of ways because it has visibility and point of interaction.
  - Interacting and gaining trust grants an entity unrestricted and free access
    to the bicycle.
  
+ Using *access and *trust to log into another person's web-mail 
  account.
 - Access: using visible pores of the web-mail, interact, test the mail
    account
 - Visit login page of the web-mail account.
 - Feed the point of interaction [email and password] with numerous inputs.
 - Gain unrestricted access from the mail account with trusted inputs.
 - Trust: When trust is gained from the mail account, unrestricted 
    access is granted.
     
 - Build trust with the mail owner
 - Gain the mail account credentials
 - Access the web-mail account based on the *trust gained from account
   owner
   
                Feed Your Head: Espionage
Espionage: Hacking against foreign government; commit criminal act, breaking and entering,
    trespassing, theft and destruction to get the edge in political or military information.

Economic Espionage: Foreign business hacking against another business in a different country.

DoXing: Hacking to get private information of an individual to embarass them publicly.

Document grinding/osInt: Digging out public information of a target for and attack.

Network surveying: Hacking done to understand a company network, system, applications and devices
    as the target of an attack without actual intruding or trespassing.

Competitive intelligence: Hacking to deeply understand competitor without breaking any laws.

                The Four Point Process (FPP)
* Types of interactions in Hacking: What happens when you poke a target
    using *Echo Tests, including expected and unexpected interactions
    with a target, to trigger response.
   - Trust and Access
   - Visibility
   - Exposure.

* Porosity is the basis of attack surface. It is the pores or "holes"
   in any defenses that you have to have in order for any necessary
   interactions to take place as well as unknown or "unnecessary" 
   interactions taking place. Knowing *porosity is important to
   protect yourself or attack a target.

* The Echo Process
   Interacting by poking to determine whether dead or alive. The *Echo
   Effect requires throwing different type of *Access interactions at
   a target and then monitoring its reactions to figure out ways you
   can interact with it; Thus *cause-and-effect type verification. It
   is the basic and immature form of analysis, although it makes for a
   very fast test but not very accurate.

* The Four Point Process
+ Induction
    What can we tell about the target from its environment? How does it
    behave in that environment? if the target is not influenced by its
    environment, that's it interesting too.
+ Inquest
    What signals [Emanations] does the target gives off? Investigate any
    tracks or indicators of those emanations. A system or process
    generally leaves a signature of interactions with its environment.
+ Interaction
    What happens when you poke the target? This point calls for echo
    tests, including expected and unexpected interactions with the
    target, to trigger responses [Cause-and-effect].
+ Intervention
    How far will the target "bend" before it breaks? Intervene with the
    resources the target needs, like electricity, or meddle with it's
    interactions with other systems to understand the extremes under
    which it can continue operating.
 
#* Example: How you would use FPP to know if a clock is working - and
    if it's working correctly by keeping the right time.
#+ Answer:
- Interaction: Observe the the clock hand if it's rotating as it should.
- Inquest: Does the minute hand rotate after every 60 seconds [Cycle of seconds]
- Intervention: Adjust the clock settings and observe the time.
- Induction: What is the current time in the area that the clock is
    being examined.
