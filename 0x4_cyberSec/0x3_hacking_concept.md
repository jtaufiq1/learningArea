# --[ HACKING CONCEPTS & ETHICAL HACKING
## HACKING, A RESEARCH
Hacking is a research. Examining something in order to get deep understanding of its internal State, how it works and modify it to suits your need. That is hacking!

Hacking can be used for good or malicious activities. Some includes:
    - Exploiting system vulnerabilities and bypassing security controls.
    - Gaining unauthorized access to an Information System or resources on it.
    - Modification of systems or application features to attain a malicious goal

The effect of unethical hacking can lead to bad consequencies to a system or an organization
Motives Behind hacking are diverse. Some hack as a hobby whiles others hack for malicious intentions.
    - Gain more knowledge, Recognition
    - Theft, Distrupt services
    - Curiosity and many others
* Hacker
    - Creative individual with excellent skills in computer & computer networking.
    - Creates and explores software and hardware and even with the ability to discover vulnerabilities in a system.
* Hacker Classes
     - White Hat
     - Black Hat
     - Grey Hat
     - Script Kiddies
     - Suicide Hackers
     - Cyber Terrorists
     - Hacktivists
     - State-Sponsored Hackers

## ETHICAL HACKING
A Structured and Organized security assessment, a crucial component of Risk Assessment for Security Auditing or Penetration Test.
Using hacking tools, tricks and techniques to identify vulnerability and ensure system security by simulating the techniques used by attackers to verify existence of exploitable vulnerabilities in a system's security.
It is done with the permission of concerned authorities.

* Why Ethical Hacking is necessary
  - To uncover vulnerabilities
  - To enhance security awareness
  - To strengthen security posture of an organization or information system
  - To prevent hackers from gaining access to information systems and Security breaches.
  - And to safeguard customer data.
* Scope of Ethical Hacking
  - Risk Assessment
  - Auditing
  - Counter fraud
  - Information System security best practices
  - Defines the coverage needed to identify risk(s)
  - Highlight remedial actions and resolves vulnerabilities.
* Limitations
  - Unless organization knows what they want from the risk assessment, less experience may be gained from hiring external pentester
  - Ethical hackers can only help organizations to understand their security posture. It is the duty of the organization to place the right safeguard on the network.
* Skills of an Ethical Hacker
    + Technical Skills
        - In depth knowledge of Operating Systems (Linux/Unix, Windows, MacOS)
        - Networking concepts, technologies and related hardware/software
        - Computer expert and Knowledge about security related issues
        - "High Technical" knowledge for launching sophisticated attacks.
    + Non-Technical Skills
        - Learnability and adaption to new technologies
        - Strong work ethics and problem solving and communication skills
        - Awareness of standards and laws

### STAGES/PHASES OF ETHICAL HACKING
*  Reconnaissance
    Preparatory stage when an attacker gathers info about the target. Range may include target org-clients, network, systems etc.
    There are 2 types of Reconnaisance: Passive Recon & Active Recon
    - Passive recon: No direct interaction with the target.
    - Active recon: Involves directly interaction with the target.
* Scanning (Pre-Atttack Phase)
    Active probing of target before attacking. Scanning the network for specific information.
    Types of Scanners: Network mappers, Port scanner, ping tools, vulnerability scanners.
    Information extracted from this stage is used to launch attack.
* Gaining Access
    Obtaining access; Access can be OS, Application or Network Level and can escalate privileges to obtain complete control.
    Password cracking, DDoS, Buffer Overflow, Session Hijacking are some the ways of taken control of target system.
* Maintaining Access
    Retaining ownership of compromised system. Securing exclusive access with Backdoors, rootkits and trojans.
    Allows download, manipulation of data/application/configuration of the system. And a launch point for further attacks.
* Clearing Tracks
    Activities carried out by an attacker on compromised system to;
    - Hide malicious acts
    - Maintain access
    - Avoid detection
    - Deleting/overriding evidence to avoid suspicions

    Attackers/Hackers always cover their tracks.
