# BEING A HACKER
================
Hackers are motivated, resourceful and creative; they get deeply into how things work to the point that they know how to take control of them and change them into something else.

They re-think big ideas because they can really get into the bottom of how things work/function.

They aren't afraid of making the same mistakes just out of curiosity; to see that if that mistake has the same results.

Hackers don't see failure as a mistake or a waste of time. Failure means something new is to be learned.

Hackers enjoy challenging themselves to tinker with everything they have (Resilience).

## HACKING AS A RESEARCH
-------------------------
Hacking is a research process. Although it doesn't follow formal hypothesis.
It involves deeply examine something, make adjustment and pushing it beyond its normal operation.

Effective research, learning and critical thinking are skills for a hacker.
That's what separate the hacker and the script Kiddie.

Hacking is a creative process that is based on lifestyle that involves identifying and disseminating and learning to discover the unknown, modify and extend capabilities.

### Essential Skills
* Critical thinking
* Effective Research
* Determination (Resilience) & Dedication

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep knowledge gives you great power. Cool things can be done with hacking skills.
Any knowledge that can help you to a point that you can take control of what is in your hand. That is hacking!

1. Hacker Handle: Establish a handle
    handleList = [m1rakuru, m1ra, mirakuru, unixWarl0rd, WarL0rdWu, unixWu, l0rdWu]
    handle.setHandle(handleList[])
2. Join IRCs
3. Delve into HowTos

    - devFeelings
    - engagePractices
    - escalatePractices
    - exfiltrateTargets

## HOW TO HACK
---------------
Using OSSTMM as a guide to learn hacking in this documents.

Learning how to hack involve developing the skills, feeling and intuition by practising. And then keep practising.

### Ways to get what you want.
1. Take it yourself
2. Have someone take it for you

All takens requires **INTERACTIONS** between the person and the thing.

Some of this interactions are between people, things or systems that 
are familiar with each other. This interaction is called **TRUST**.

But when the interaction is between unknown people, things or systems, it is called **ACCESS**.

You can use access to take what you want OR you can trick someone who has
trust with the target to take it for you.

SECURITY means protecting something (an assert) from both those it doesn't know but have access to it and those it knows and trusts.

- Espionage:
    Hacking against foreign government; commit criminal act, breaking and entering, trespassing, theft and destruction to get the edge in political or military information.
- Economic Espionage: Foreign business hacking against another business in a different country.
- DoXing: Hacking to get private information of an individual to embarass them publicly.
- Document grinding/osInt: Digging out public information of a target for an attack.
- Network surveying:
    Hacking done to understand a company network, system, applications and devices as the target of an attack without actual intruding or trespassing.
- Competitive intelligence: Hacking to deeply understand competitor without breaking any laws.

## HACKING TO TAKE OVER YOUR WORLD
-----------------------------------
Hacking is all about taking control of something or changing it. Having freedom to make something you own do what you want. And then keep others from changing something you own.

For many people, Security is about putting a product in a place that 
theorotically keeps them secure. Security products are meant to reduce Attack Surface. But sometimes, products comes with their own problems or don't work as they should. Thus, increasing the attack surface when it should be shrinking it.

-- Attack surface is all the ways, all the interactions that allow something/someone to be attacked.
-- You hack security to analyze the product to figure out where it fails and how to change it so it works better. Then hacking some more to prevent changing it back to the default.   
-- Breaking security is one area that hacking is useful for protecting your own privacy.

Another type of interaction known as **VISIBILITY** is also very powerful as the other two. It is simplified as an opportunity to know if there is something to interact with or not.

This interaction brings a whole lot of security techniques like deception, illusion and camouflage as well as all-new hacking techniques for avoiding and getting around security measures like deception, illusion and camouflage!

Privacy is the opposite of visibility. It is a powerful way to avoid being a target. To avoid attacks in the first place, Keep a low **EXPOSURE** and avoid visibility.

### Types of interactions in Hacking
What happens when you poke a target using echo tests, including expected and unexpected interactions with a target to trigger response?

* Visibility & Exposure:
    If an asset is visible, it can be attacked, but if it is not visible, it can be targeted - though it could be discovered.
    Security doesn't have to last forever, just longer than anything else that might notice it's gone.
    **Means, Motive and Opportunity** is necessary to attack a visible asset.
* Access:
    The number of different places where interactions can occur to the outside of the scope with another entity within the scope.
    Trust is both a security hole and a common replacement for authentication.
* Trust: When an entity accepts free interaction with another entity within the scope.

## THE FOUR POINT PROCESS (FPP)
-------------------------------
The Echo Process: Poking to check the status of the target.
    Interacting by poking to determine whether the target is dead/alive. We grow up discovering things and learning things by interacting with them directly. Poking to check the status of something (Dead/Alive) is known as the _ECHO PROCESS_ (Cause-and-Effect type verification).

    It requires throwing different types of access interaction at a target and then monitoring its reactions to figure out what ways you can interact with it i.e. send request, receive responds.

    It is the basic and immature form of analysis, although it makes for a very fast test but not very accurate.

    Eg: A target that doesn't respond to an echo process is considered secure. Which is the same as not having visibility.
    Not responding to a particular type of interaction does not mean it is secured. Avoiding visibility might help you survive some types of attacks but not all.

The Four Point Process outlines 4 ways the basic interactions are used to analyze something as deeply as possible (Mess with it, watch it and observe the outcome).

The **FPP** has you look at interactions in the following ways:
* Induction
    What can we tell about the target from its environment? How does it behave in that environment?
    Is the target influenced by it environment? - if not, that's interesting too.
* Inquest
    What signals (emanations) does the target gives off? Investigate any tracks or indicators of those emanations.
    A system or process generally leaves a signature of interactions with its environment.
* Interaction
    What happens when you poke the target?
    This point calls for echo tests, including expected and unexpected interactions with the target to trigger responses (Cause-and-effect).
* Intervention
    How far will the target "bend" before it breaks?
    Intervene with the resources the target needs, like electricity, or meddle with it's interactions with other systems to understand the extremes under which it can continue operating.

Example:
    How you would use FPP to know if a clock is working - and if it's working correctly by keeping the right time.
Answer:
    - Interaction: Observe the the clock hand if it's rotating as it should.
    - Inquest: Does the minute hand rotate after every 60 seconds [Cycle of seconds]
    - Intervention: Adjust the clock settings and observe the time.
    - Induction: What is the current time in the area that the clock is being examined.

## WHAT TO HACK
----------------
Deep knowledge gives you great power. Hack everything but harm none.

When Hacking anything, you need to set up some ground rules. The language and concepts to know what you're actually hacking.

The _Scope_ is the word used to describe the total possible operating environment, which is every interaction that the thing you want to hack has.

_Don't think you can just be a great hacker only by doing great hacks, with humility can you be great._

## CLASSES & CHANNELS
----------------------
The scope is made up of 3 classes that subdivides to 5 channels.

Classes define an area of study, investigation, or operation. Channels are common terms for the ways you interact with assets.

* Physical Security (PHYSEC): Human and Physical
* Spectrum Security (SPECSEC): Wireless
* Communication Security (COMSEC): Telecommunications and Data Networks.

### Asserts & Dependencies
* An Asset can be anything that has value to the owner. It can either be physical property or an intellectual property. 
* Dependencies are the things beyond the asset owner's ability to provide independently.

The goal of Security is separation between an asset as well as its dependencies and any threat to them. Thus Security is a function of Separation.
There are 4 ways to create this separation:
    - Move the asset to create a barrier between it and the threats.
    - Change the threat to a harmless state.
    - Destroy the asset. **(Not Recommended!)**

## POROSITY: The basis of attack surface
----------------------------------------
Porosity is simply the pores/holes in any defenses you have in order for the necessary interactions to take place as well as unknown/unnecessary interactions taken place.
Knowing porosity helps in protecting yourself from attack or help to attack some target but not enough to analyze something to hack it.

When we're hacking, we look for places where interactions with the target are possible and where they are not.
How pores can be located, classified and determined in the hacking process.
The more porosity there is, the more likely a hacker can make changes and control what they want.

## RESOURCES
