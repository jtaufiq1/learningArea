Unit Objectives
---------------
* Use CIA and AAA to explain Cybersecurity activities
* Explain the balance between security and availability

=======================================================================
# CIA MODEL
=======================================================================
The CIA-Triad is a security model that has been develop to help people 
think about various part of IT security. It is a well known model for IT
security policy development.

This principle is applicable to the whole subject of IT security Analysis
from access to user's internet history to security of encrypted data across
the internet.

The CIA stands for,
   * Confidentiality,
   * Integrity and
   * Availability

# Confidentiality
-----------------
This is the most obvious part when it come to security in IT and the most
often attacked.

It is the ability to hide information to prevent unauthorized access.

Protecting the confidentiality of information is dependent on being able to
define and enforce certain access levels. This ensures that information
systems are only accessed by those authorized to access it.

Doing this involves separating information into various collections that are
organized by who needs to access them and how sensitive that information is
and amount of damage it will cause when it is breached.

It is implemented using security mechanisms such using usernames and
password, cryptography and encryption, Access Control Lists (ACL), Unix file
permissions.

# Integrity
-----------
Data Integrity is an essential component of the CIA-Triad. It is designed to
ensure that information is in an unchanged form and accurate of the original
information.

It requires that data that is being processed or information that is stored
has not been changed from its original form. Hence it protects data or
information from modification and deletion either Accidentally/Maliciously.

This is done through hashing and encryption.

# Availability
--------------
The final component of the CIA-Triad. It ensures that information is readily
available when those authorized to access it need it. It Ensures that all 
authentication mechanisms, access channels and systems are functioning 
properly.

It requires that authorized users, processes are able to do their job and 
information is readily available when it is needed. That is full tolerance
and load balancing in the event of disaster.

High availability systems are systems that have architectures designed
specifically to improve availability. These systems may target hardware failures,upgrade and power outages or manage several network connections to
improve availability of information.

=======================================================================
# AAA MODEL
=======================================================================
The AAA model is another important cybersecurity model that simply means
Authentication, Authorization and Accounting.

# Authentication
----------------
The first A refers to authentication. It is the process of proving your 
identity.

[Authentication != Identification]

Authentication requires proof in one of three possible forms:
- Something you know; like password.
- Something you have; like a key fob, cell phone.
- Something you are; biometrics.

Multi-Factor Authentication or 2-Factor Authentication is employed for a
reliable authentication.

Authentication can done in different ways.
- Static password
- One Time Password
- Biometrics
- Digital Certificates

# Authorization
---------------
Authenticated entities must be authorized to perform certain task. It can be
used to enforce policies; It can be used to determine the type/level of
access or action a user is permitted to carry out on a system.

It involves specifying access rights to resources, system services, data on
an information system.

The principle of least priviledges requires that users and devices must be
granted sufficient accessess necessary to perform required function.

Unnecessary authorization can result in an accident or violation or security
policy.

# Accounting
The process of keeping track of activities of an authenticated and authorized
user/device attached to system. Logging all activities that is carried out
by a user/device. It is used to measure the amount of resources used by user
or device. And it used to detect breaches and for forensic purposes.

=======================================================================
# SECURITY vs CONVINIENCE
=======================================================================
Cybersecurity involves tradeoff. Balancing security and convinience is very
important. Little to no security on system makes it juicy for attackers.
High security can also hinder users from doing their jobs.

Cybersecurity professionals has to figure out how to balance security and
convinience in a system.

=======================================================================
# THREAT AGENT/THREAT ACTORS
=======================================================================
Entities that cause or contribute an incident. They carry threat can that 
exploit a vulnerability.

# Internal Threat
Threat that originate with an organization.

# External Threat
Threat outside the organization.

* Natural Threat
* Human Threat

# Partner Threat
Third party sharing business relation with an organization

# RISK
-------
It is the combination of the probability of an event and its consequencies.

Risk can be managed/mitigated or Transferred but cannot be avoided
completely.

* Mitigate
* Transfer
* Accept
